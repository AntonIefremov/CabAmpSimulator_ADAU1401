Used a basic microPython firmware for raspberry pi pico - https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/#getting-started-with-micropython

lib for rotary encoder - https://github.com/miketeachman/micropython-rotary

install lib to MCU - 

- PC\yourPC>ampy -p COM2 put link_to_localFile\rotary.py
- PC\yourPC>ampy -p COM2 put link_to_localFile\rotary_irq_rp2.py

Need to install ampy and Python 3.6 on PC. More info about library copy to rpi pico - https://github.com/scientifichackers/ampy
