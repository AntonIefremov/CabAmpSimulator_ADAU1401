Project was moved to ESP32 and uses a ESP-WROOM-32D module. (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32959124944.html)
Mainly SMD, but still a big size of elements - so, you can solder it using a basic solder.
Board and schematic you can find on open source project on EASYEDA/OSHW-LAB -https://oshwlab.com/Aiefremov/adau1401_cabsim_project 
or using EASY-EDA editor for board: https://easyeda.com/editor#id=32c89cb965fb450cb41693555ac78b16
      
You can easily order a PCB from EASYEDA using a "Fabrication" menu -> "PCB Fabrication File (Gerber)..." and then select an "ORDER PCB/SMT at JLCPCB" button. It's only $2 for 5 great, professional PCB. 
Or you can use a my Gerber file for make it youself.
