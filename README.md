# CabAmpSimulator_ADAU1401

This project is a guitar amplifier and bass amplifier simulator based on ADAU1401 Digital Signal Processor and ARM-microcontroller (ex. Raspberry Pi Pico). 

## Functionality:

- Output amplifier emulator. 
- IR-Based cabinet simulator.
- Load third-party IR (.wav files) via microSD card. 
- Two push/rotary encoders for Volume and on/off control
- Balanced output (XLR-socket)
- Unbalanced input
- Standard 9V power supply. 

## Project contain:

- Sprint Layout 6.0 PCB
- Python Script with nessesary functions and code for comunication between user actions and DSP for raspberry pi pico
-
